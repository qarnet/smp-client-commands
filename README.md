# smp-client-commands

The goal of this project is, to make it possible to easily update one nrf device, from another. The concept will mainly revolve around one of the devices needing uart access, to received the individual chunks. I haven't looked into USB and how viable that could be.

In case someone got lost inside of github and stumbled upon this project. I'd appreciate any more ideas.
